# MiSTer_UnofficialCores
Unofficial builds of MiSTer Arcade Cores with the ROMs injected.

## Some known issues: ##
* At lower HDMI resolutions, text may appear uneven/distorted.
* There may be shimmering, most noticeable at lower resolutions
* "Advanced" scaler options (Hq2x, CRT) may have visual artifacts
* There may be other unintended visual issues. If this is the case, use the official core for your setup.

## Notes: ##
* I have created and provided some custom Filters
* Arcade ROMs have been injected into the RBF files for you already so they are plug and play ready
* I have provided the ROM files as well
* All core licenses and original cores can be viewed at the official project page: https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki
