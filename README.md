# MiSTer_UnofficialCores
Unofficial builds of MiSTer Arcade Cores with the ROMs injected. These Cores are for testing/educational purposes only.

## Usage ##
* Download Update_RetroDriven.sh and save it to your Scripts folder on your MiSTer SD Card(typically /media/fat/Scripts).
* Optional: Download Update_RetroDriven.ini and save it to your Scripts folder. You can change the INI file as needed but it is not required.
* Simply run the Update_RetroDriven.sh via MiSTer Menu to Download/Update the ROM injected Cores

## Notes ##
* Arcade ROMs have been injected into the RBF files for you already so they are plug and play ready.
* I have created and provided some custom Filters.
* All core licenses and original cores can be viewed at the official project page: https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki
* The Source Code of the Cores have not been changed at all.
* Each Core has the ROM injected via the Open Source RBF Tool located here:https://github.com/funkycochise/RbfTool
