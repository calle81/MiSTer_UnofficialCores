# MiSTer_UnofficialCores
Unofficial builds of popular MiSTer cores built using the Filter Options for HDMI.

All core licenses and original cores can be viewed at the official project page: https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki

The goal of these Unofficial Cores is to enable the Filter scaling method where needed, which wil provide different scaling options within Core's OSD.

## Some known issues: ##
* At lower HDMI resolutions, text may appear uneven/distorted.
* There may be shimmering, most noticeable at lower resolutions
* "Advanced" scaler options (Hq2x, CRT) may have visual artifacts
* There may be other unintended visual issues. If this is the case, use the official core for your setup.

## Notes: ##
* I have created and provided some custom Filters
* Arcade ROMs have been injected into the RBF files for you already so they are plug and play ready

## Instructions: ##
* Update your MiSTer binary to the latest version
* Download Filters here: https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Filters_MiSTer/tree/master/Releases
* Extract Filters Folder to the root of your SD Card
* You will be able load the different Filters real time from the Core's OSD
