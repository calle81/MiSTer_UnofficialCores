# MiSTer_Coeff
Unofficial builds of popular MiSTer cores built using Coefficient scaling options for HDMI.

All core licenses and original cores can be viewed at the official project page: https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki

The goal of these unofficial cores is to enable the Coefficient scaling method, which wil provide different scaling options within the coeff.txt file for a core.

## Some known issues: ##

*   At lower HDMI resolutions, text may appear uneven/distorted.
*   There may be shimmering, most noticeable at lower resolutions
*   "Advanced" scaler options (Hq2x, CRT) may have visual artifacts
*   There may be other unintended visual issues. If this is the case, use the official core for your setup.


## Notes: ##
I consider this a stop-gap solution to satisfy more demanding users as the scaling matures in the main project. These should be considered unstable test builds for enthusiasts, and in time I hope an equivilent or better solution for a clear HDMI scaler becomes available without special builds.

## Instructions: ##
* Update your MiSTer binary to the latest version
* Place Filters folder(Coeff Files in the folder) on the root of your SD card
* You will be able load the different Coeffs real time from the Core's OSD now!
